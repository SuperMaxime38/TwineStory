The next day, you wake up at 1 p.m. again, but today it's not your alarm clock that wakes you up, but your phone ringing. 
It's SFR! You start talking to them, but the tone escalates. They remind you that you are already four months behind on your subscription and that the late fees are skyrocketing.
Finally, you can no longer ask for more time, and they end up telling you that in two days, you will have to pay 120 euros. They hang up on you. 
So you wonder what to do. Ignore these threats and continue playing your favorite games, or look for a way to earn money?
