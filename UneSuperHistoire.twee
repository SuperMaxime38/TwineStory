:: \ Hack the bank a 2nd time {"position":"3375,525","size":"100,100"}
You <strong>need</strong> this money so you have to take risks.
They still have cybersecurity but you may have the power now to defeat them.

How to proceed ?

[[Trojan Horse]]
[[Brute-force attack]]
[[find a Zero-day vulnerability]]


:: \ steal a 1M {"position":"4525,1125","size":"100,100"}
I mean, for a small transfer your attack could have worked, but you will learn that when it comes to millions of dollars a human is checking if the transfer is correct.
You put your own account as the receiver so they know exactly who you are.

When you discover that you miserably failed, you're starting to sweat (more than usual), you already hear the sirens of the cops coming to your house, and you enjoy a last game of LoL before going to jail.

[[The cops are in front of my house]] 


:: \ steal a thousand {"position":"4525,1025","size":"100,100"}
(set: $money to $money + 1000)

You're a greedy boy, but somehow the guy in charge of checking transfers was a middle school intern.
You're now rich, you can pay your bills and even buy skins !
You feel relieved ðŸ˜Œ

[[I can now do the thing I love the most: play LoL->Victory]]


:: A charming woman you've noticed a few times on the bar terrace, but also on her Instagram profile, because right now she's on it, sending messages but mostly photos ( possibly compromising photos that could be used for a ransom). {"position":"1550,875","size":"100,100"}
(set: $goodChoices to $goodChoices - 1)
Even though you've seen the advice on Reddit, you're still hooked on her Instagram photos, and even if you catch one of the photos she sent (man in the middle), it's just a cute cat photo :(Â 
Her phone quickly spots you and she logs off the Wi-Fi (yeah, gotta stay focusedâ€”it's not her beach photos that are gonna make you money...)

:: A young student, probably on the phone with his family ( maybe using phishing with family members, or using a context that would push him to send you money). {"position":"1525,575","size":"100,100"}
Unfortunately, the penniless student is no myth, and all you manage to get from him is his student ID number and his IZLY account (which has been empty for some time).
His situation is understandable, given how stingy his parents are (you can't find any way to get even a few cents out of them, which makes you almost feel sorry for him).

[[The sun is setting]]


:: Ask yourself an existential question about your weight and your level in this game that drives you crazy {"position":"1125,625","size":"100,100"}
After thinking it over for a long time (2 min 37 sec),
you decide that life is worth living the way you want to live it, and you decide to get back on LOL, more determined than ever.

:: I ABSOLUTLY NEED TO FIND MONEY {"position":"1425,700","size":"100,100"}
<div class="Long">[Forced to find a way to get money, you decide to abandon the idea of robbing a homeless person (it wouldn't bring in enough, you'd have to do it too many times...). However, you've always been good at hacking and dodging security systems on the internet.
After searching around online, you come across a really helpful Reddit thread on how to access a device on free Wi-Fi.
This is perfect because you live below a pretty busy bar where you've always been able to use the Wi-Fi, even though it's not as bad as you'd think.
So, on Monday morning (it's already 3 p.m., but you've just woken up), you decide to delve deeper into this network, which is certainly not the most fiable.
But there's nothing interesting, since most users are just checking their emails or watching boring videos, so you'll have to wait until tonight to get more interesting information (yet another reason to play XD).
After a couple of 20 games, each worse than the last, you decide to check out the famous Wi-Fi that's supposed to make you rich in a few days, and you quickly realize that you're not the only one using it at night.
Several profiles come to you:]

[[A young student, probably on the phone with his family ( maybe using phishing with family members, or using a context that would push him to send you money).]]Â 

[[A man who is probably nearing the end of his life, but who seems to be very fortunate (he has multiple new-generation devices connected to this Wi-Fi), visiting a website whose name you don't know, but which could be compared to a video or live call according to the Wi-Fi information.]]

You can now transfer money to your bank account.
However, with this access to the system, you could steal more money than needed and SFR won't ever annoy you again !

You can process a transfer to you own account, how many money will you rob:
(set: _needed_money to 120 - $money)
[[Just enough money to pay my bills (_needed_money $)->steal just enough]]
[[A little bit more, I took risks I get rewards (1000$) -> steal a thousand]]
[[Imagine how many skins I could buy with 1M (steal 1M$) -> steal a 1M]]


:: search in main.f90 {"position":"3975,1150","size":"100,100"}
You trained hard to become an actual hacker, still there's not a lot of people that are able to read and understand Fortran. The code looks like chinese to you and after spending a few hours reading you still don't understand any functions.

You got an SMS from SFR telling you that your internet has been stopped.

(set: $reason to "you failed your hack")
{
(set: _time to 6)
(live: 1s)[
	(set: _time to it - 1)
	(if: _time is 0)[
		(goto: "Lose page")
	]
]
}


:: sleep and dream of a better life with grass and shower {"position":"1125,1000","size":"100,100"}
You're not sleeping well and you dream of all your lost games. You can hear a voice whisper to you that you're going to stay hardstuck bronze until your death.

:: sql injection {"position":"3875,725","size":"100,100"}
Bank systems uses Fortran to run, which is a very old programming launguage.
Knowing that they still use this outdated technology, maybe they forgot to patch SQL injections.

You're in front of the admin login panel and you try to log in (yeah that's what a login panel is usually used for).

Your cursor is placed on the identifer field:
[[Execute $name OR 1=1 ->working sql injection]] 
[[Execute $name ; DROP TABLE BankAccounts ->bad sql injection]] 


:: steal just enough {"position":"4525,925","size":"100,100"}
(set: $money to 120)

You stole just enough money to pay your bills, SFR will be happy and so are you.
You can now play LoL day and night until someone else threaten you to cut your internet... or electricity.

[[Get back to gaming->Victory]]


:: working sql injection {"position":"4100,700","size":"100,100"}
Fortunately for you SQL are still a thing in 2025.
You currently have $money $ and you need 120$ in order to pay your bills.
However, with this access to the system, you could steal more money than needed and SFR won't ever annoy you again !

You can process a transfer to you own account, how many money will you rob:

(set: _needed_money to 120 - $money)
[[Just enough money to pay my bills (_needed_money $)->steal just enough]]
