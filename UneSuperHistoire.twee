:: \ Hack the bank a 2nd time {"position":"3375,525","size":"100,100"}
You <strong>need</strong> this money so you have to take risks.
They still have cybersecurity but you may have the power now to defeat them.

How to proceed ?

:: A charming woman you've noticed a few times on the bar terrace, but also on her Instagram profile, because right now she's on it, sending messages but mostly photos ( possibly compromising photos that could be used for a ransom). {"position":"1550,875","size":"100,100"}
(set: $goodChoices to $goodChoices - 1)
Even though you've seen the advice on Reddit, you're still hooked on her Instagram photos, and even if you catch one of the photos she sent (man in the middle), it's just a cute cat photo :( 
Her phone quickly spots you and she logs off the Wi-Fi (yeah, gotta stay focused—it's not her beach photos that are gonna make you money...)

[[Ok let's hack the student->A young student, probably on the phone with his family ( maybe using phishing with family members, or using a context that would push him to send you money).]] 

[[Ok let's hack the elder->A man who is probably nearing the end of his life, but who seems to be very fortunate (he has multiple new-generation devices connected to this Wi-Fi), visiting a website whose name you don't know, but which could be compared to a video or live call according to the Wi-Fi information.]]

[[I will hack his webcam->public wifi attack]]


:: A young student, probably on the phone with his family ( maybe using phishing with family members, or using a context that would push him to send you money). {"position":"1525,575","size":"100,100"}
Unfortunately, the penniless student is no myth, and all you manage to get from him is his student ID number and his IZLY account (which has been empty for some time).
His situation is understandable, given how stingy his parents are (you can't find any way to get even a few cents out of them, which makes you almost feel sorry for him).

[[The sun is setting]]


:: Ask yourself an existential question about your weight and your level in this game that drives you crazy {"position":"1125,625","size":"100,100"}
After thinking it over for a long time (2 min 37 sec),
you decide that life is worth living the way you want to live it, and you decide to get back on LOL, more determined than ever.

After another two hours of intense gaming, it's the same old story: you lose...
You've given the game your last ounce of strength and you fall asleep with your face on the keyboard.
Good night ;)

Your ringtone is ringing , you wake up at at 1 p.m. like every day, after all.
You sit on your used gaming chair drink a redbull and start playing your unique and favorite game League of Legend !
After 15 min of fight even after all your efforts you lose, you're still bad at it, and another defeat awaits you in the next game.
You also dream of getting the new skin of arhis but  you remind that you're unemployed and you don't even have enough money to pay your internet provider.
The night start to fall, will you sleep later and continue to play or you won't stop because its your 20th lose of the day?

:: I ABSOLUTLY NEED TO FIND MONEY {"position":"1425,700","size":"100,100"}
<div class="Long">[Forced to find a way to get money, you decide to abandon the idea of robbing a homeless person (it wouldn't bring in enough, you'd have to do it too many times...). However, you've always been good at hacking and dodging security systems on the internet.
After searching around online, you come across a really helpful Reddit thread on how to access a device on free Wi-Fi.
This is perfect because you live below a pretty busy bar where you've always been able to use the Wi-Fi, even though it's not as bad as you'd think.
So, on Monday morning (it's already 3 p.m., but you've just woken up), you decide to delve deeper into this network, which is certainly not the most fiable.
But there's nothing interesting, since most users are just checking their emails or watching boring videos, so you'll have to wait until tonight to get more interesting information (yet another reason to play XD).
After a couple of 20 games, each worse than the last, you decide to check out the famous Wi-Fi that's supposed to make you rich in a few days, and you quickly realize that you're not the only one using it at night.
Several profiles come to you:]

[[A young student, probably on the phone with his family ( maybe using phishing with family members, or using a context that would push him to send you money).]] 

[[A man who is probably nearing the end of his life, but who seems to be very fortunate (he has multiple new-generation devices connected to this Wi-Fi), visiting a website whose name you don't know, but which could be compared to a video or live call according to the Wi-Fi information.]]

It's SFR! You start talking to them, but the tone escalates. They remind you that you are already four months behind on your subscription and that the late fees are skyrocketing.
Finally, you can no longer ask for more time, and they end up telling you that in two days, you will have to pay 120 euros. They hang up on you. 
So you wonder what to do. Ignore these threats and continue playing your favorite games, or look for a way to earn money?
