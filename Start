Ur ringtone is ringing , u wake up at at 1 p.m. like every day, after all.
U sit on ur used gaming chair drink a redbull and start playing your unique and favorite game League of Legend !
After 15 min of figth even after all your efforts you loose, you're still bad at it, and another defeat awaits you in the next game.
You also dream of getting the new skin of arhis but  you remind that you'r unemployed and you don't even have enough money to pay your internet provider.
The nigth start to fall did you will again sleep later and continue to play or you wan't stop because its ur 20th loose of the day?
Choice 1: Continue to loose   Choise 2: Ask yourself an existential question about your weight and your level in this game that drives you crazy       Choise 3: sleep and dream of a better life with grass and shower
